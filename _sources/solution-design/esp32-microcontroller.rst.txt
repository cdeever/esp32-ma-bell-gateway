Selecting the right ESP32 variant can be surprisingly tricky. There are dozens of versions—ESP32-C2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-WROVER, WROOM-32, and more—each with its own trade-offs in price, peripherals, core count, wireless support, and package size. After researching compatibility, availability, and feature sets, the **ESP32-WROOM-32** was chosen for this project.

This module strikes an ideal balance for the Ma Bell Gateway:

- ✅ **Dual-core processor (Xtensa LX6 @ up to 240 MHz)** – The ESP32 includes two powerful cores. **Core 0** is generally reserved for system-level tasks such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth stacks, while **Core 1** runs the user application logic (e.g. GPIO handling, tone generation, state machine transitions). This separation is key for real-time responsiveness.
- ✅ **Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Classic** – Both are essential. Wi-Fi is used to serve a real-time web-based status page, and Bluetooth Classic enables call connectivity via the Hands-Free Profile (HFP).
- ✅ **FreeRTOS included** – The ESP-IDF framework includes a full **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** that manages multitasking, timers, inter-task communication, and more. The Ma Bell Gateway uses FreeRTOS features to juggle Bluetooth events, off-hook signaling, tone generation, and status updates without blocking.

Bluetooth Classic vs BLE
========================

Although many ESP32 variants support **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**, this project requires **Bluetooth Classic** due to its support for audio via the **Hands-Free Profile (HFP)**. BLE is optimized for short, energy-efficient data bursts (e.g. sensors, beacons), but it does not support voice or audio streaming. For this reason, only ESP32 modules that include Bluetooth Classic were considered.

Simultaneous Wi-Fi + Bluetooth
==============================

While Wi-Fi and Bluetooth share the same radio hardware, the ESP32 manages coexistence through fast time-sharing and protocol scheduling. With proper configuration:

- Wi-Fi can serve the internal status page and support future OTA updates.
- Bluetooth Classic can maintain a call session with a mobile phone.
- System tasks and phone logic remain responsive, even during heavy traffic.

The ability to reliably run both wireless stacks alongside real-time GPIO handling was a key reason the WROOM-32 was selected.
