Enclosure Design
================

The Ma Bell Emulator is housed in a standard 19" rack-mountable chassis, aligning with modern home lab and telecom setups. This form factor allows it to integrate cleanly into existing infrastructure while preserving modularity and accessibility.

The device serves as a central analog line emulator for traditional phone wiring throughout the house. While many homes still have legacy phone jacks, this project routes the phone service through RJ-45 connectors, supporting modern structured wiring conventions (e.g., using patch panels or wall plates with RJ-45).
