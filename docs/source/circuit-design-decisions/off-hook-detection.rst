Scored Off-Hook Detection Circuit Design Decision Matrix
=========================================================

This table ranks different off-hook detection circuit design approaches based on risk to ESP32 (safety & isolation), reliability, simplicity (novice-friendly), cost, and other relevant features. The approaches are ordered from oldest to newest technology mirroring the progression the CO would have used over the decades.  

While Solid-State relays were not used by the COs for off-hook detection, this approach was considered anyway for this project.

Final Thoughts
==============

- **Optocoupler is the best choice overall** ‚Üí Safe, reliable, and simple to implement.
- **SSR is also an excellent option** ‚Üí Easiest for beginners but slightly more expensive.
- **Mechanical relays provide historical accuracy and the "click" sound**, but they wear out over time.
- **Resistor + Transistor is cheap and historically relevant but exposes the ESP32 to risk.
