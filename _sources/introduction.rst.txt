Introduction
============

The Ma Bell ESP32 Gateway project began after a visit to the Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) Midwest in Chicago in September 2024. One of the exhibits featured a functioning corporate PBX switch system with modules from different eras, with functioning analog phones connected and able to call each other — the kind once found in nearly every home. It was a glimpse into the infrastructure that powered everyday communication for decades.

Seeing those phones in action brought back vivid memories of the telephone in my childhood kitchen — a lighted ITT Slimline rotary phone mounted on the wall with a super long cord, and a standalone Western Electric ringer mounted along the baseboard, its twin bells clearly audible throughout the house.

After returning home, I browsed eBay for fun and wondered if I could find the same phone for sale, as well as the ringer we used to rent from the phone company. To my surprise, I found a brand new, never-used Slimline ITT phone — New Old Stock (NOS) — still wrapped in the box since 1982. It likely became unused inventory as touch-tone and cordless phones began to take over in the early '80s.

I also managed to find the exact ringer variant as well — the Western Electric stand-alone ringer with two chime modes — evoking memories of the distinctive “bing... bong” that would inevitably sound every night just as we sat down to eat dinner. I was thrilled. These were exactly like the ones from my childhood, and a question quickly followed:

**Could I bring this phone fully back to life?**

Of course, devices already exist that allow vintage telephones to connect to modern Bluetooth systems. But as a software developer with a growing interest in embedded systems and electronics, I wondered:

**Could I build my own?**

One that rings, lights up, dials, and behaves exactly as it did in its heyday — not just functionally, but authentically.

That question evolved into a full embedded systems design and implementation challenge: one that would bridge mid-century analog hardware with modern digital tech, while staying faithful to the look, feel, and behavior of the original system.

At a high level, the project required:

- **Selecting a microcontroller** capable of handling Bluetooth audio (HFP), real-time signaling, and GPIO control. The ESP32-WROVER-IE was chosen for its robust feature set and community support.
- **Designing analog and digital circuits** to simulate the phone company’s central office — including loop current, ringing voltage, tone generation, and rotary pulse decoding.
- **Developing custom PCBs** to integrate power management, signal conditioning, audio routing, and isolation in a compact, reliable form.
- **Prototyping and validating each subsystem**, from ringer triggering to audio passthrough and dial tone playback.
- **Designing a rack-mountable or wall-mountable enclosure**, with standard RJ-11 ports and clearly labeled indicators.

What began as a nostalgic side project became a multi-disciplinary engineering effort — blending firmware, circuit design, mechanical design, and a deep respect for the phone system that connected generations.

This documentation walks through the journey from idea to fully operational gateway.
