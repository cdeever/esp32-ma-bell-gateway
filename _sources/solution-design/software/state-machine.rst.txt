State Machine
=============

The Ma Bell Emulator state diagram defines the system's operational states, including idle (on-hook), dialing, call setup, active call, and termination. It models transitions for pulse dialing, Bluetooth connection handling, ringer activation, and tone generation, ensuring seamless integration between the vintage phone, ringer, and a mobile phone via Bluetooth.
