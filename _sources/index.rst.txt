**Ma Bell ESP32 Mobile Bluetooth Gateway**

This project brings a vintage rotary phone back to life in its former, fully functioning glory — just as if it were 1978.

Powered by an ESP32, the system simulates the original phone company Central Office (CO) — aka “Ma Bell” — providing loop current, dial tone, ringing voltage, and rotary pulse interpretation. Behind the scenes, it bridges the call over Bluetooth using the Hands-Free Profile (HFP), allowing the phone to work with your modern smartphone.

**Features**

- Rotary dialing translated to mobile calls  
- Mechanical bell ringer powered and triggered just like the original line  
- Two-way voice communication  
- Power for the light-up rotary dial  
- Tone simulation including dial tone, busy signal, and more  

Once common in every home, this phone rings again — not as a relic, but as a working link to our analog past.
