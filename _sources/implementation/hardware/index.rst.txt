This section covers the electronic components, circuit design, wiring, and PCB layout required to assemble the Ma Bell Gateway.

- **Bill of Materials (BOM):**  
  List all required parts, including power supplies, microcontroller (ESP32), relays, optocouplers, transformers, connectors, and legacy phone hardware.

- **Schematic and Wiring:**  
  Provide schematics and wiring diagrams for the main power domains, off-hook detection, ringer signaling, and audio path.

- **PCB Layout:**  
  Discuss any custom PCB(s) used, highlighting isolation gaps, mounting holes, and connector placement. Include Gerber files or references to open-source layouts if available.

- **Assembly Notes:**  
  Give tips for soldering, cable management, testing for shorts/opens, and verifying voltages before applying power to vintage hardware.
