Off-Hook Detection
========================

An **off-hook detection circuit** is required to sense when a telephone receiver is lifted—completing the subscriber loop between tip and ring—so that the system can recognize an attempt to place or answer a call.

The challenge is that this loop typically carries **high voltages (up to 48V DC idle, 90V AC ringing)**, while modern microcontrollers like the **ESP32 operate at just 3.3V and cannot safely interface with the line directly**. Therefore, any detection method must safely **isolate the ESP32** from the phone line while accurately identifying the off-hook condition.

Several design approaches were evaluated based on how well they meet this need—balancing **electrical safety, reliability, simplicity, and cost**—while also reflecting the technologies used historically by telephone central offices (COs).

   * - **Era**
     - **Detection Approach**
   * - 1900s–1940s
     - Mechanical relays closed when loop current flowed, activating electromechanical switching gear.
   * - 1950s–1970s
     - Transistor-based circuits began replacing relays in local switching systems, offering smaller, quieter alternatives.
   * - 1970s–1990s
     - Optocouplers appeared in digital switches to isolate analog lines from microprocessors.
   * - 2000s+
     - SSRs and integrated analog front-ends are common in VoIP ATAs and digital PBXs for safe, silent switching.

Final Thoughts
==============

- ✅ **Optocoupler is the best all-around option** – safe, reliable, and minimal complexity.
- ✅ **SSR is beginner-friendly and silent**, great for plug-and-play setups, though slightly pricier.
- ✅ **Mechanical relay brings classic authenticity** with that iconic CO click—but at the cost of longevity.
- ⚠️ **Resistor + transistor is historically vintage**, but exposes the ESP32 and requires extra protection.

Even if only one method is chosen for implementation, telling the story of all four helps illustrate how telephony evolved—and adds fun, educational depth to your project.
