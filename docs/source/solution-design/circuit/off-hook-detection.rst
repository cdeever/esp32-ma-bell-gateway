Off-Hook Detection
========================

An **off-hook detection circuit** is required to sense when a telephone receiver is lifted‚Äîcompleting the subscriber loop between tip and ring‚Äîso that the system can recognize an attempt to place or answer a call.

The challenge is that this loop typically carries **high voltages (up to 48V DC idle, 90V AC ringing)**, while modern microcontrollers like the **ESP32 operate at just 3.3V and cannot safely interface with the line directly**. Therefore, any detection method must safely **isolate the ESP32** from the phone line while accurately identifying the off-hook condition.

Several design approaches were considered, including the possibility of applying **authentic historical circuit styles** used by central offices (COs), alongside modern alternatives that offer improved safety and integration.

Final Thoughts
==============

- ‚úÖ **Optocoupler is the best all-around option** ‚Äì safe, reliable, and simple to integrate.
- ‚úÖ **SSR is beginner-friendly and silent**, offering a plug-and-play solution at slightly higher cost.
- ‚úÖ **Mechanical relay adds authentic charm**, but with mechanical wear over time.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resistor + transistor is the least safe**, and while it‚Äôs historically relevant, it places the ESP32 at risk without careful protection.

In this project, the **optocoupler-based circuit** will be used for off-hook detection. It provides galvanic isolation from the phone line and allows the ESP32 to monitor the line safely. The implementation will require:

  - A **current-limiting resistor** on the optocoupler's input side  
  - Careful matching of the **forward voltage (Vf)** and current for reliable triggering  
  - A **pull-up resistor** or logic input to the ESP32 on the output side  
  - Optional use of a **Schmitt trigger or GPIO interrupt** for clean digital transitions

This approach reflects how later-generation COs managed line isolation while providing a practical and safe solution for modern embedded design.
