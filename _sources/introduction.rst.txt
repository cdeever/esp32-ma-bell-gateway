Introduction
============

The Ma Bell ESP32 Gateway project began after a visit to the Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) Midwest in Chicago in September 2024. One of the exhibits featured a partially restored central office switch and a display of working rotary telephones — the kind once found in nearly every home. It was a glimpse into the infrastructure that powered everyday communication for decades.

Seeing those phones in action brought back vivid memories of the telephone in my childhood kitchen — a lighted ITT Slimline rotary phone mounted on the wall, with a standalone Western Electric ringer mounted along the baseboard, its twin bells clearly audible throughout the house. 

After returning home, I browsed eBay for fun and happened to find a NOS Slimline ITT phone and ringer — just like the ones we used to rent from the phone company — and a question quickly followed:

**Could I bring this phone fully back to life?**

Of course, devices already exist that allow vintage telephones to connect to modern Bluetooth systems. But as a software developer with a growing interest in embedded systems and electronics, I wondered:

**Could I build my own?**

One that rings, lights up, dials, and behaves exactly as it did in its heyday — not just functionally, but authentically.

That question evolved into a full embedded systems design and implementation challenge: one that would bridge mid-century analog hardware with modern digital tech, while staying faithful to the look, feel, and behavior of the original system.

At a high level, the project required:

- **Selecting a microcontroller** capable of handling Bluetooth audio (HFP), real-time signaling, and GPIO control. The ESP32-WROVER-IE was chosen for its robust feature set and community support.
- **Designing analog and digital circuits** to simulate the phone company’s central office — including loop current, ringing voltage, tone generation, and rotary pulse decoding.
- **Developing custom PCBs** to integrate power management, signal conditioning, audio routing, and isolation in a compact, reliable form.
- **Prototyping and validating each subsystem**, from ringer triggering to audio passthrough and dial tone playback.
- **Designing a rack-mountable or wall-mountable enclosure**, with standard RJ-11 ports and clearly labeled indicators.

What began as a nostalgic side project became a multi-disciplinary engineering effort — blending firmware, circuit design, mechanical design, and a deep respect for the phone system that connected generations.

This documentation walks through the journey from idea to fully operational gateway.
