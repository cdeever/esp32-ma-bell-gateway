Solution Design
===============

This section documents the **design decisions** for the Ma Bell Gateway project—the "what" and "why" of the system architecture, not the "how" of building it.

**What You'll Find Here:**

- **Design Alternatives:** Multiple approaches considered for each subsystem
- **Trade-Off Analysis:** Pros, cons, and constraints for each option
- **Decision Rationale:** Why specific components and approaches were chosen
- **Requirements:** Functional and non-functional requirements that drove decisions

**Design vs. Implementation:**

The design section focuses on *choices*—evaluating options, weighing trade-offs, and documenting decisions. The implementation section focuses on *execution*—how to actually build the chosen design, with schematics, code, and assembly instructions.

For historical context on Bell System standards and engineering philosophy, see :doc:`/historical-perspective`.
