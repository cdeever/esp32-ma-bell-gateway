Introduction

The Ma Bell ESP32 Gateway project began after a visit to the Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) Midwest in Chicago in September 2024. One of the exhibits featured a functioning corporate PBX switch system with switch modules from different eras. You could pick up the phone and dial the other extension — just as one did in the old days, complete with the familiar instruction to “dial 9 first for an outside line.” It was a glimpse into the telephone infrastructure that powered everyday communication for decades.

Seeing those old phones in action brought back vivid memories of my GenX childhood in the 1970s. The wall-mounted phone in the kitchen, with its super-long cord that could stretch across the room, was often cradled between my mom’s shoulder and cheek as she chatted — the soft orange glow of the illuminated dial lighting her face while she prepared Hamburger Helper in the electric skillet. Just below the phone sat the ringer, with its beige plastic case and oversized twin bells, designed to be heard throughout the entire two-story house. Without fail, it would deliver its distinctive “bing... bong” right at 6 o’clock, just as we were sitting down to enjoy Mom’s Hamburger Helper for dinner.

After returning home, I browsed eBay for fun and wondered if I might find the same phone and ringer we used to have. Amazingly, I found the exact beige **ITT Trimline** wall phone and a matching **Western Electric** stand-alone ringer — both in near-perfect condition.

Opening the box felt like peeling back a layer of history. The ITT Trimline phone, model **25413/BA/30M**, was still wrapped in its original plastic — untouched since it was packaged in **September 1982**, as confirmed by the ink-stamped label on the side: “**BEIGE 9/82 WALL RR**.” After more than 40 years in storage, the phone was in pristine condition — the coiled cord still neatly tucked, the rotary dial crystal clear, and the plastic smelling faintly of the era it came from. The illuminated rotary dial glowed warmly when the handset was lifted — casting that unmistakable orange light on your cheek as you chatted away.

The Western Electric ringer was equally authentic — a device not seen since childhood. It was a solid, standalone unit with durable plastic and large twin bells, ready for duty once again.

**Could I build my own device to bring this new-old phone a chance at life?**

Of course, there are already devices on the market that let vintage telephones connect to modern Bluetooth systems. But as a software developer with a growing interest in embedded systems and electronics, I wanted something more than just functional — I wanted to build this device myself as an educational journey into both the inner workings of the original telephone service and the expanding skillset of a hobbyist electronics engineer, embedded software developer, and maker. This project would demand skills across all these areas.

Could I build something that rings, lights up, dials, and behaves exactly as it did in its heyday — replicating not just the signals but the entire experience?

That question evolved into a full embedded systems design and implementation challenge: one that would bridge mid-century analog hardware with modern digital tech, while staying faithful to the look, feel, and behavior of the original system.

At a high level, the project requires:

- **Selecting a microcontroller** capable of handling Bluetooth audio (HFP), real-time signaling, and GPIO control. The ESP32-WROVER-IE was chosen for its robust feature set and community support.
- **Designing analog and digital circuits** to simulate the phone company’s central office — including loop current, ringing voltage, tone generation, and rotary pulse decoding.
- **Developing custom PCBs** to integrate power management, signal conditioning, audio routing, and isolation in a compact, reliable form.
- **Prototyping and validating each subsystem**, from ringer triggering to audio passthrough and dial tone playback.
- **Designing a rack-mountable or wall-mountable enclosure**, with standard RJ-11 ports and clearly labeled indicators.

What began as a nostalgic side project became a multi-disciplinary engineering effort — blending firmware, circuit design, mechanical design, and a deep respect for the phone system that connected generations.

This documentation walks through the journey from idea to fully operational gateway.
