The Bell System Blueprint
=========================

Before the rise of digital switching and VoIP, the **Bell System** established a rigorous engineering model for delivering reliable analog phone service across millions of subscriber lines. At the heart of this model was the **subscriber line interface**—the circuit that connected each individual phone to the central office (CO).

To standardize the functions of these circuits, Bell Labs engineers coined the acronym **BORSCHT**, which neatly summarizes the core services every line interface must provide. This framework guided the design of **line cards** like the Western Electric 400E and its descendants—modular units that delivered service to one subscriber each and operated faithfully for decades inside CO switching racks.

This section explores the engineering principles and historical evolution of the Bell System's subscriber line technology—the foundation upon which the Ma Bell Gateway is built.

- **BORSCHT Model** – The seven core functions every subscriber line interface must provide
- **Voice Transmission** – How the Bell System achieved clear, full-duplex audio over two wires
- **Signaling Tones** – The evolution of dial tone, ringback, and busy signals
- **Dialing Methods** – From rotary pulse dialing to Touch-Tone DTMF
- **Power Domains** – The standard voltages that powered telephone equipment
