**Ma Bell ESP32 Mobile Bluetooth Gateway**

This project brings a vintage rotary telephone back to life — not as a novelty Bluetooth handset, but as a fully functioning telephone just as it was in 1978.

The ESP32 acts as a digital gateway, connecting legacy Bell System hardware to the modern mobile network. The phone rings authentically, the dial pulses are interpreted, and voice is carried over Bluetooth using the Hands-Free Profile (HFP).

Features:
- **Rotary dialing** translated to mobile calls
- **Mechanical bell ringer** powered and triggered just like the original line
- **Loop start and off-hook detection** with proper isolation
- **PCM/I2S audio pipeline** for two-way voice communication

This is not a prop. This is a real phone call — made the way it used to be.
