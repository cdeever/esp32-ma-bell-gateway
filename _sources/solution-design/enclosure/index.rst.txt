Enclosure Design
================

The Ma Bell Bluetooth Gateway is designed to be housed in a 1U 19-inch rackmount enclosure, but beyond its form factor, the enclosure must accommodate a range of functional and electrical components, both legacy and modern. This section outlines the enclosure requirements and the design considerations for each face of the unit.

Front Panel
-----------

The front panel presents the device’s user-facing controls and status indicators. Key elements include:

- **Power button** — momentary switch with integrated LED ring (e.g., 12V or 5V illuminated)
- **Status LEDs** — at minimum:
  - `STATUS` (system operational)
  - `BT` (Bluetooth connection/activity)
- **Monochrome display** — optional LCD or OLED panel (e.g., I2C 128x32) to show pairing status, call state, or diagnostics
- **Optional ventilation slots or mesh** — depending on internal power supply heat dissipation
- **Rack ears** — standard 19" mounting flanges with holes for rack screws

Back Panel
----------

The rear panel must handle all external I/O and power connections:

- **Analog Phone Ports**
  - **RJ45 jacks** for phone lines (e.g., use inner pair for standard RJ11 wiring)
  - Marked clearly as `PHONE 1`, `PHONE 2`, etc.
  - Connected internally to circuitry providing ringing voltage, loop current, and rotary pulse decoding

- **Antenna Ports**
  - **Bluetooth antenna** — external SMA connector for improved range
  - **Wi-Fi antenna** — optional second SMA or integrated antenna cutout
  - Use proper panel-mount pigtail leads to connect SMA to ESP32 U.FL or onboard headers

- **AC Power Section**
  - **Dedicated 9V AC input jack** — used exclusively for rotary dial lamp or bell voltage simulation
  - **Main AC inlet (IEC or barrel jack)** — powers the internal PSU
  - Internally fused and possibly switched

- **Grounding Lug (optional)** — for proper chassis grounding in vintage-friendly or lab environments

Internal Layout Considerations
------------------------------

The enclosure must accommodate and isolate:
- **Custom PCB(s)** for power delivery, signal conditioning, and ESP32 control
- **Audio coupling transformers and opto-isolated circuits**
- **AC-DC power supply unit** — potentially a small enclosed module or DIN-rail PSU
- **Voltage step-up/step-down regulators** — for bell voltage, lamp power, ESP32 logic, etc.
- **Cable routing paths** — to keep AC and signal wires separated and reduce noise
- **Standoffs or brackets** — for securely mounting boards and modules

Labeling and Aesthetics
-----------------------

For clarity and authenticity, the enclosure should include:
- Silk-screened or engraved labeling for ports and indicators
- Iconic "Ma Bell" or Bell System-style typography (optional)
- A matte black or brushed aluminum finish for a professional appearance

Future-Proofing
---------------

Consider adding:
- **Ventilation for PSU heat**
- **Knockouts or blank panel areas** for expansion (e.g., Ethernet, USB debug port, SD card access)
- **Access panel or removable lid** for serviceability
