Off-Hook Detection
========================

An **off-hook detection circuit** is required to sense when a telephone receiver is lifted‚Äîcompleting the subscriber loop between tip and ring‚Äîso that the system can recognize an attempt to place or answer a call.

The challenge is that this loop typically carries **high voltages (up to 48V DC idle, 90V AC ringing)**, while modern microcontrollers like the **ESP32 operate at just 3.3V and cannot safely interface with the line directly**. Therefore, any detection method must safely **isolate the ESP32** from the phone line while accurately identifying the off-hook condition.

Several design approaches were considered, including the possibility of applying **authentic historical circuit styles** used by central offices (COs), alongside modern alternatives that offer improved safety and integration.

Final Thoughts
==============

- ‚úÖ **Optocoupler is the best all-around option** ‚Äì safe, reliable, and simple to integrate.
- ‚úÖ **SSR is beginner-friendly and silent**, offering a plug-and-play solution at slightly higher cost.
- ‚úÖ **Mechanical relay adds authentic charm**, but with mechanical wear over time.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Resistor + transistor is the least safe**, and while it‚Äôs historically relevant, it places the ESP32 at risk without careful protection.

In this project, the **optocoupler design will be used**. It ensures **galvanic isolation** from the phone line and allows the ESP32 to detect off-hook status without direct exposure to high voltage. A typical implementation requires:
- A **current-limiting resistor** to protect the opto input,
- Proper matching of the **forward voltage (Vf)** to ensure reliable triggering,
- And optionally, a **Schmitt trigger or GPIO interrupt** on the output side for edge detection.

This balances authenticity, safety, and simplicity while staying faithful to the spirit of vintage CO design.
