==================================
Off-Hook Detection Circuit Design
==================================

Different off-hook detection circuit design approaches were considered based on key criteria:

- **Safety & isolation** (risk to ESP32)
- **Reliability** (false triggers, wear & tear)
- **Simplicity** (novice-friendliness)
- **Cost**
- **Other relevant features** (like sound, power use, integration ease)

These approaches are ordered from oldest to newest technology, mirroring the progression central offices (COs) used over time. While Solid-State Relays (SSRs) weren't used historically for off-hook detection, they're considered here for their modern advantages.

Final Thoughts
==============

- ✅ **Optocoupler is the best overall** – safe, reliable, and simple.
- ✅ **SSR is excellent for beginners** – plug-and-play, but slightly pricier.
- ✅ **Mechanical relay adds classic authenticity**, but will wear out over time.
- ⚠️ **Resistor + transistor is cheapest**, but exposes ESP32 to risk and is less reliable.
