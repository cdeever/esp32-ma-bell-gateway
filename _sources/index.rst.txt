**Ma Bell ESP32 Mobile Bluetooth Gateway**

This project brings a vintage rotary telephone back to life as a fully functioning telephone — just as if it were 1978.

Powered by an ESP32, the system simulates the original phone company Central Office (CO) — aka “Ma Bell” — providing loop current, dial tone, ringing voltage, and rotary pulse interpretation. Behind the scenes, it bridges the call over Bluetooth using the Hands-Free Profile (HFP), allowing the phone to work with your modern smartphone.

**Features**

- **Rotary dialing** translated to mobile calls  
- **Mechanical bell ringer** powered and triggered just like the original line  
- **Loop start and off-hook detection** with proper isolation  
- **PCM/I2S audio pipeline** for two-way voice communication  

This project provides a new generation with an authentic 1970s telephonic experience.
